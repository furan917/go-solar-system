# Go Solar System Explorer ðŸš€

Yeah, so this is basically a terminal app where you can explore space stuff. It's pretty cool I guess. Still working on it though.

## What it does

- Navigate around planets with your keyboard (because who needs a mouse in space?)
- Shows you actual NASA data about planets and their moons
- Has some neat visualizations that look surprisingly good in a terminal
- Can switch between different star systems (Solar System, Alpha Centauri, some Kepler thing, etc.)
- Real-time orbital animations because why not

## How to run it

```bash
git clone https://github.com/furan917/go-solar-system.git
cd go-solar-system
go mod tidy
go run main.go
```

That should work. If it doesn't, uh... check if you have Go installed?

## Controls (the important stuff)

**Basic navigation:**
- Arrow keys = move around
- Enter = see planet details
- Numbers 1-9 = jump to specific planets/sun
- S = switch between star systems
- Q = quit (or Escape, whatever)

**When looking at planet details:**
- M = view moons (if the planet has any)
- B = go back
- Q = still quits

**Moon stuff:**
- Up/Down = navigate moon list
- Enter = moon details
- Escape/B = back to planet

## Current features (aka what actually works)

- âœ… All the basic planet browsing stuff
- âœ… Real NASA/JPL data (pretty accurate)
- âœ… Moon exploration (with way too many of Jupiter's moons)
- âœ… Multiple star systems with actual exoplanet data
- âœ… Binary and triple star systems (they actually orbit each other!)
- âœ… Mouse clicking on planets (surprisingly satisfying)
- âœ… Orbital animations that don't make your terminal explode
- âœ… Asteroid belts because why not

## What's still broken/TODO

- Some UI components are being refactored (it's a work in progress, okay?)
- The help system could be better
- Probably need more error handling
- Could use more star systems
- Maybe add export functionality someday

## Architecture (for the nerds)

```
â”œâ”€â”€ main.go                    # Entry point
â”œâ”€â”€ internal/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ models/               # Planet/moon data structures
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ api/                  # Talks to NASA APIs
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ visualization/        # Makes pretty terminal graphics
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ systems/              # Star system management
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ui/                   # Modal components (new hotness)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ app/                  # Main app logic (some legacy stuff)
```

The code follows some clean architecture principles, mostly. There's a bit of legacy code hanging around that I'm slowly cleaning up.

## Testing

```bash
go test ./...
```

Tests exist and they pass (usually).

## Data sources

Uses real data from:
- [Solar System OpenData API](https://api.le-systeme-solaire.net/en/)
- NASA/JPL databases
- Various exoplanet catalogs

## Star systems included

- **Solar System**: Our neighborhood (obviously)
- **Alpha Centauri**: Closest star system with some interesting planets
- **Kepler-452**: Has "Earth's cousin" planet
- **TRAPPIST-1**: 7 Earth-sized planets, pretty cool
